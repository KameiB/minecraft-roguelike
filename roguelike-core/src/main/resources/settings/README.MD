These settings serve mostly as examples of how Dungeon Settings could be written.

There are errors here and there, and I am always accepting pull requests for corrections.

In no way are these settings balanced. Use at your own risk.

At some point, I'll be releasing a series of composable packs of settings for players to pick and choose from.
